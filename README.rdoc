== NZTrain

=== Installation
Run `script/install.bash` to install dependencies.

`script/update.bash` will pull changes from origin and recompile various things. This includes assets - assuming that it is for production purposes.

Both scripts depends on `script/install.cfg`, which is built using `script/install/config.bash` automatically.
